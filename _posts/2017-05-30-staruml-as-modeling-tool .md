I used a couple of UML Modelling Tools in the past, such as Rational Rose, RSA, ArgoUML and so force. Unfortunately,some of them are always space consumer as lots of useless features for new comer; RSA, for example, needs more than 7 Gigabits after fully installation; some of them are ugly in terms of UI.

StarUML, however, is the best one I ever use, which is only 100 Megabits after installing. This may be the primary point attracting me to choose it.

One sentence used to describe this handy tool on its official website is stated as following:

> "StarUML is an open source project to develop fast, flexible, extensible, featureful, and freely-available UML/MDA platform running on Win32 platform." from [StarUML official site](http://staruml.sourceforge.net/ "StarUML")

One tip: "Word Wrap Name" button on the tool bar can be able to make string of any UML elements multiple lines showing enable by adjusting the area of them.
